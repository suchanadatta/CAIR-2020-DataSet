> We provide participants a static test collection of news articles constituting the official English ad hoc IR collection of FIRE.

> We released a training set comprising 5 topics (with the relevance assessments) followed by 20 test topics to the participants. Each topic follows the standard TREC format, i.e., is comprised of a 'title' (usually a small number of keywords) and a 'narrative' (a paragraph describing the relevance criteria in details).

> We provided participants binary relevance judgements following TREC format. This helped them to analyze the causal relevance which they need to address (instead of the topical relevance). This also enabled participants to tune prototype systems and explore a number of early approaches and with the help of the evaluation (using the provided manual assessments) to see what worked and what did not.
